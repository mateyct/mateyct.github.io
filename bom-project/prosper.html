                        It&apos;s interesting that this principle is brought up almost verbatim so many times in the Book of 
                        Mormon. There are plenty of other verses that teach the same idea in a different way. I think the Lord wants us to 
                        remember this. It&apos;s not that He wants us to be righteous with the intent to get rich, but rather He wants us to know that 
                        if we work hard to follow Him and keep His commandments, He will take care of us. He also wants us to use that 
                        prosperity to help others.
