                <h3>Pre-Class Reading</h3>
                <p>
                    I arrived in Provo a week before school started, and right after I settled in, 
                    I got an email from the American Heritage professors. It was one of the classes 
                    I was taking, and they informed me that before the first day of class, there were 
                    four long readings I needed to complete, including a 26-page syllabus. That set a 
                    precedent for what the workload of college would be like. That got me really worried,
                    and I started to stress. Eventually, I realized that not all assignments would be
                    so extensive. From this experience, I learned that I need to remain optimistic and 
                    not let one experience ruin my perception of how things will be. This has enlarged
                    my intellect.

                <h3>First Day of Class</h3>
                <p>
                    Within the first few moments of my first real class at BYU, I knew that I was in an 
                    environment where the Holy Spirit takes the lead in teaching. I was in my computer 
                    science class, and my professor shared a spiritual thought and then asked someone 
                    to say a prayer. I thought that was so cool. Throughout the week, I noticed that 
                    several of my professors did the same thing. For one, this helped me feel the Spirit, 
                    but more importantly, it helped me feel comfortable. I just returned from my mission, 
                    and being removed from that constantly-spiritually environment was a little hard for me. 
                    At this moment, I felt like I was at home, where I was supposed to be. That is why I know 
                    that BYU will help strengthen me spiritually.

                <h3>Finding a Job</h3>
                <p>
                    After a couple weeks of school, I started feeling like I needed to find work. 
                    Many of the people around me were working while doing school, and I decided I 
                    wanted to work as well. I started the job hunt, and at first it didn&apos;t really 
                    go anywhere. I was really putting a lot of effort into it, but none of the jobs 
                    that appealed to me were reaching out. I didn&apos;t want to do unskilled labor, and 
                    maybe it sounds prideful, but I knew I had experience that would qualify for lots 
                    of jobs, specifically computer science related jobs. After a lot of searching, I 
                    applied to a website development job, and I finally got an interview. The whole 
                    interview process went well, and I ended up getting the job. It&apos;s been a challenge 
                    for me to work and do school, but it&apos;s helped me learn to be productive with my 
                    time and balance multiple things.
