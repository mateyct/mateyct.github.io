            <p>Glad you could make it to my site. Hopefully you can learn something about my experience at BYU.</p>

                    <h3>Why am I here?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Brigham Young University was not always my plan. Before BYU, I had a list of schools that I wanted to choose from, and
                        BYU was at the bottom of my list. At this time, I'm still not completely sure why I decided to go to BYU, but one thing
                        I do know is that I am glad I came. I feel that I am supposed to be here right now. I think part of the reason I came
                        had to do with certain friends that were coming here, but there was also something that drew me. I took a tour of BYU,
                        and I didn't get a strong pull to come here at that time, but over time, the desire grew. Eventually, I decided to come
                        to BYU. I eventually went on my mission to South Africa, and there were a couple of times that I began to doubt my 
                        decision to come to BYU. After fasting and prayer, I felt better and realized that I had made a good choice. Now, based
                        on my experiences since I've been here, I can confidently say that I am glad to be here.

                    <h3>Who do I hope to become?</h3>
                    <p>
                        At BYU, I will have lots of opportunities to grow and progress as a person. I want to use this chance that I have to 
                        become the best that I can. My main goals in life are to become a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ, a caring husband,
                        and a loving father. My future career will help me accomplish these tasks because it will give me the financial means
                        necessary, but it it's a means to an end, not the end itself. BYU can help me with these goals. BYU provides
                        a special environment where learning can be guided both by academic procedure and the Holy Ghost. I can meet other people
                        in the same stretch of life as me. I can access resources that will strengthen my learning and development. I can learn
                        technical and soft skills that will help me throughout my life. Ultimately, these will help me to become a disciple-scholar,
                        a husband, and a father.

                    <h3>How can I serve others?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Part of what I hope to do in my life is to be a blessing in the lives of others. Each person has unique experience and knowledge
                        that can make a difference, including myself. Everyone has various needs, and I can help fulfill those needs as I go forth in
                        life with an attitude of service. The ways I can serve others are several, but in my life and during my time at BYU, I want to
                        focus my service on things that relate to the skills that I have. One thing I plan to do is to help others academically. I have
                        always excelled in school and learning, and I don't mean to brag, but I know that because I've been blessed with a keen mind,
                        I can help others as well. Whether in school, work, or anything else, I know that I can of service. I think that's one of the best
                        ways I can serve other people.
