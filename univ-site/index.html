                    <h3>Why am I here?</h3>
                    <p>Brigham Young University was not always my plan. Before BYU, I had a list of schools that I wanted to choose from, and
                        BYU was at the bottom of my list. At this time, I'm still not competely sure why I decided to go to BYU, but one thing
                        I do know is that I am glad I came. I feel that I am supposed to be here right now. I think part of the reason I came
                        had to do with certain friends that were coming here, but there was also something that drew me. I took a tour of BYU,
                        and I didn't get a strong pull to come here at that time, but over time, the desire grew. Eventually, I decided to come
                        to BYU. I eventually went on my mission to South Africa, and there were a couple of times that I began to doubt my 
                        decision to come to BYU. After fasting and prayer, I felt better and realized that I had made a good choice. Now, based
                        on my experiences since I've been here, I can confidently say that I am glad to be here.
