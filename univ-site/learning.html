                <h3>Spiritually Strengthening</h3>
                <p>
                    BYU has played a big part in my spiritual growth. Since being at BYU, I&apos;ve 
                    been able to better understand and connect gospel principles with academic facts. 
                    I love how BYU strives to create an environment where the Holy Ghost can be felt and 
                    guide the professors in their teaching. This has helped me to grow my testimony and 
                    succeed in my academic endeavors. It is great to be surrounded by people that share my 
                    beliefs and understand the background that I come from, making it easier to create 
                    connections with others.

                <h3>Intellectually Enlarging</h3>
                <p>
                    Since I&apos;ve been at BYU, I&apos;ve felt my mind expand and grow in capability. 
                    I&apos;ve had to work very hard to balance my learning, work, and other activities in a 
                    productive way. I&apos;ve learned to be more efficient and thorough in my studies and 
                    projects. BYU has rigorous courses, and that has forced me to push myself. I&apos;ve also 
                    become more motivated to gain skills and understanding of as many things as I can.
                </p>

                <h3>Character Building</h3>
                <p>
                    Being at BYU has motivated me to work to grow myself and strive to attain Christlike attributes. 
                    Since my mission, I&apos;ve understood the importance of trying to be more and more like Jesus Christ. 
                    This requires a lot of effort and prayer. BYU emphasizes the need to build our character and 
                    become like Jesus Christ, and I want to work towards that. I have and will continue to identify 
                    ways I can improve, then set goals and make plans to achieve those things. I have learned that 
                    often it is necessary to improve ourselves before we can accomplish certain thing or become who we want to be.

                <h3>Lifelong Learning &amp; Service</h3>
                <p>
                    Serving others and growing my knowledge throughout my life are both things that I want to do. Learning in 
                    school is good, and of course it is concentrated more than at other times, but learning won&apos;t end when I 
                    graduate. I need to spend my life trying to grow my mind and acquire knowledge and skills. This is important 
                    for several reasons, but a major reason is that it will allow me to better serve those around me. For one, I 
                    can help others to learn things. I can also apply my skills and knowledge to do things that make a difference 
                    in the lives of others. For example, perhaps I will someday use my programming abilities to make something 
                    that helps someone in need.
